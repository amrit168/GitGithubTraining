Hello!! GCA Team, 
I am really excited to share my experience of learning Git for past 3 days. I had little knowledge on using Git and Github before this  
such as only basics like add new file or changes, committing, pushing and pulling. After taking this course i can proudly say that i came to 
know more about Git and Github. Our instructor Mr. Milan Thapa have brillantly taught every topic very simply and effectively making everyone 
go with him which was quite impressive and helpful as many of the participant were begineer as well.
I have been following GCA's event from some time and i feel like they have been providing many useful webinars which are much effectively 
for students and tech enthusiast. Looking forward for more webinars on network automation ,cloud and cybersecurity. At last i want to thank entire GCA and GIT team with 
Mr. Milan Thapa for providing such an effective and wonderful session.
